# Hello-Baby
My foundation landing page project.

I have learned a ton about how to use HTML, CSS, and flexbox in particular, to make pages look great and be responsive. I have created a made up company landing page. looking forward to finish this page so i can move forward and work on my Javascript and add that functionality to new projects when the time comes.
